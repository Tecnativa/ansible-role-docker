Set up docker servers with all of the docker project software stack.

## Requirements

Only [Ansible on Python 3][ansible-py3] is supported.

Supported operating systems:

- Ubuntu:

  - 16.04
  - 18.04

## Role Variables

You are allowed to set just one dict variable: `docker_role_custom`.

It must be in the same format as `docker_role_defaults`, which can be found in
the `vars/main.yml` file. Read there to understand how it works.

When the role gets executed, the first thing it will do is to combine both of
those dicts recursively into a new `docker_role` variable. Rely on that one
if you need to query any configurations in other roles or tasks.

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- hosts: docker
  roles:
  - role: yajo.docker
    vars:
      docker_role_custom:
        app: &install
          present: true
        compose: *install
        engine: *install
        machine: *install
        swarm: *install
```

For a bigger example, go see [our test playbooks][test].
